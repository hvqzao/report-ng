    # Web Application Security Assessment Reporting

    The idea behind is to speed up the preparation stage of penetration
    testing and dynamic scanning reports as well as make it more uniform.

    ## Basics

    Microsoft Office Word is being used to prepare report templates.
    HP WebInspect and BurpSuite Pro scan exports might be used as input
    data for the report as well.
    XML, Yaml and Json are used as input formats.
    Report in Openxml format is the final product of this application.

    Error traceback is on. If you will work with templating and wont stick
    to the rules presented below, you will very likely encounter it.

    ## GUI Interface

    Main application window contains four fields that act as an input
    (drag & drop is supported):
    - Template - Word report template
    - Content - additional data that should be automatically propagated
      to the report
    - Scan - HP WebInspect / Burp Suite Pro scan
    - Knowledge base - knowledge base that could be used to reinforce
      final report customization

    Double click on given text area will popup the content on larger area.

    ## CLI Interface

    Command-line support has been added in order to allow bulk generation
    of report-files. Application currently supports one set of switches:
    
    -t template-file [-c content-file] [-k kb-file] [-s scan-file]
    -r report-file

    ## Word Template Preparation

    This application was tested with Office 2010 Word documents saved with
    Word XML Document format.

    To prepare a template Developer tab must be enabled on Word's Ribbon.
    Rich Text Content Control on Developer tab is used to mark parts that
    should be used for templating. All Rich Text Controls in order to be
    properly recognized must have Title property set using Properties.
    Design Mode is also handy.

    Before I start with templating, few introductionary words: Word document
    itself is organized in an xml structure which more or less sticks to the
    HTML layout principles. There are paragraphs (p), inline text (run ~ span),
    tables, table rows (tr), table row columns (tc) and others. When content
    is marked using Rich Text Content Control it gets encapsulated. So when
    you encapsulate a whole line - it will work as paragraph, part of inline
    text - will work as a span etc. When during templating you will use multi
    line content, it will be splitted and added in multiple tags. Therefore,
    one should keep in mind that while paragraphs will work as expected, span
    blocks will just be contatenated. Margin settings for paragraphs will be
    propagated across each line of template content. Run parent might be run,
    paragraph or another element.

    I strongly advise to prepare your template using method of small steps.
    If you encounter some unexpected error, you will be able to revert back
    easily. Also take a look at Tools / Template structure preview wchich
    should aid you during some issues analysis.
    
    The following titles are reserved for the purpose of automated template
    population:
    
    Required fields:
    - Finding - finding template, it should include other Finding.* tags
      - Finding.Name
      - Finding.Severity - allowed: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational
        Best Practices

    Optional fields:
    - Finding.* - other fields
    - Findings.Chart - chart with all findings will be filled automatically
    - Findings.VolumeChart - auto chart listing finding occurrences count
    - Findings.Critical - placeholder for critical findings
    - Findings.High
    - Findings.Medium
    - Findings.Low
    - Findings.Informational
    - Findings.BestPractices
    - Summary.Critical - must be a row
    - Summary.Critical.Finding - will be filled with finding name
    - Summary.Critical.* - optional fields, will be put in finding template
    - Summary.High
    - Summary.High.Finding
    - Summary.High.*
    - Summary.Medium
    - Summary.Medium.Finding
    - Summary.Medium.*
    - Summary.Low
    - Summary.Low.Finding
    - Summary.Low.*
    - Summary.Informational
    - Summary.Informational.Finding
    - Summary.Informational.*
    - Summary.BestPractices
    - Summary.BestPractices.Finding
    - Summary.BestPractices.*
    - *.*.*
    - *.*
    - *

    It is recommended to arrange data in structures, e.g.:
    - Report.Name - paragraph
    - Report.Owner - span
    ...

    It is possible to prepare table templates as well, e.g.:
    - History - table row
    - History.Version - table column (or span within table column)
    - History.Date - table column
    ...
    It applies to both data and Finding structures.

    Conditionals

    Conditional blocks have been introduced to findings in the following ways:

    "if exists"
    - Surrounding template data within e.g. Finding.Critical?
      causes block to appear only for critical findings.
    - If finding includes some tag, e.g. Finding.Description, conditional
      block Finding.Description? could be added to the template. Content will
      only be rendered if finding have Finding.Description set. IMPORTANT:
      Make sure Conditional is created as block (multi-line). Once tested
      it can an attempt can be made to join it back to a single line.
      Block tag seen in Word "Developer Mode" have named closing tag.

    "if not exists"
    - if fining does not include some tag or its value is set to '',
      given block will be visible, otherwise it is removed.

    It is now also possible to add root conditional blocks for content itself.
    Example use would be e.g. adding Pentest? conditional block and few tags,
    like Pentest.Name, Pentest.Version etc. If at least one Pentest.* will
    be present and filled, block will be left, otherwise it will be removed
    from generated report.

    Counters

    When needed, summary.[finding].property# counter could be added to show
    lists volume. 

    ## Content and Knowledge Base preparation

    Content could be provided in yaml or json format. Values could be one of
    three kinds:
    - plain text
    - Regular pseudo-html data: <html>...</html>
    - Inline pseudo-html data: <ihtml>...</ihtml> - keep in mind that it
      might have some limitations and it could cause problems.

    Additionally, Knowledge Base file could be also used. It should basically
    look like findings section of content. Name and Severity fields are mandatory,
    all other are optional. If content will not provide appropiate value for
    given section, it will be taken from knowlege base, if such section will be
    available there.

    Knowledge Base might be also imported from Excel CSV file. "Vulnerability
    Name" column will be threated as Finding Name. Severity column is mandatory.
    Optional Aliases column is newline separated list of finding names. If
    finding name listed in aliases column will be present in the report and it
    will be missing dedicated Knowledge Base entry - such will work as a fallback.
    For fallback finding names listed in aliases column finding severity is being
    ignored.

    ## Inline pseudo-html allowed tags

    Following tags are available:
    - <b>...</b> - bold
    - <i>...</i> - italic
    - <y>...</y> (or <yellow>...</yellow) - yellow highlight
    - <r>...</r> (or <red>...</red>) - red text
    - <rw>...</rw> (or <redwhite>...</redwhite>) - red highlight with white text
    - <a href="...">...</a> - link (remember to use scheme in url, e.g.
      http://)
    - <font [face="..."] [size="..."]>...</font> - font, no units just a numeric
      value

    ## Regular pseudo-html allowed tags

    All inline tags could be used. Additionally available are:
    - <ul><li>...</li>...</ul> - unnumbered list
    - <ol><li>...</li>...</ol> - numbered list
    - <xl>...</xl> - supplementary, indented only list item, e.g.:
      <ul><li>item</li><xl>item description</xl><li>...</li></ul>
    - <img src="..." [alt="..."] [width="..."] /> - image, no units for width,
      just a numerical value
    - <br/> - break line

    ## Scans

    HP WebInspect 10.1.177.0 and Burp Suite Pro 1.6beta2 / 1.6.01 were used
    during initial tests. To prepare source scan data within HP WebInspect, Export
    Scan Details (Full) with XML Export Format. For Burp use Report Selected
    Issues, select XML and pick Base64-encode requests and responses.
